Logs the source of execution of all queries to the Rails log. Helpful to track down where queries are being executed in your application, for performance optimizations most likely.

## Install

Install the latest stable release:

`gem install active_record_query_trace`

In Rails, add it to your Gemfile, then restart the server:

```ruby
gem 'active_record_query_trace'
```

##Usage

Enable it in an initializer:

```ruby
ActiveRecordQueryTrace.enabled = true
```

## Options

There are three levels of debug.

1. app - includes only files in your app/, lib/, and engines/ directories.
2. full - includes files in your app as well as rails.
3. rails - alternate output of full backtrace, useful for debugging gems.

```ruby
ActiveRecordQueryTrace.level = :app # default
```

By default, a backtrace will be logged for every query, even cached queries that do not actually hit the database. You might find it useful not to print the backtrace for cached queries:

```ruby
ActiveRecordQueryTrace.ignore_cached_queries = true # Default is false.
```

Additionally, if you are working with a large app, you may wish to limit the number of lines displayed for each query.

```ruby
ActiveRecordQueryTrace.lines = 10 # Default is 5. Setting to 0 includes entire trace.
```

After any SQL query will appear a with the text `  Query Trace >  `. If
you want to change that text:

```ruby
ActiveRecordQueryTrace.header_text = 'âŒš' # This add a clock. Default is '  Query Trace >  '
```

## Output

When enabled every query source will be logged like:

```
  IntuitAccount Load (1.2ms)  SELECT "intuit_accounts".* FROM "intuit_accounts" WHERE "intuit_accounts"."user_id" = 20 LIMIT 1
Called from:
  app/views/users/edit.html.haml:78:in `block in _app_views_users_edit_html_haml___1953197429694975654_70177901460360'
  app/views/users/edit.html.haml:16:in `_app_views_users_edit_html_haml___1953197429694975654_70177901460360'
```
